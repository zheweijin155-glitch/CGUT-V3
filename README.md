Analytical derivation of physical constants using Riemann Zeta sequences (V3 framework)

Is the universe fine-tuned, or are its constants the inevitable eigenvalues of a deeper geometric structure?

This paper presents the Compact Grand Unified Theory (CGUT), a framework that derives the Standard Model and Cosmological constants from first principles, without introducing any free parameters.

Building upon the author's previous axiomatic framework of Trajectory Irreversible Entropy (Jin, 2026, DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.16580305), this work identifies the Renormalization Group (RG) flow as a geodesic motion in an entropy manifold driven by intrinsic information dissipation.

Key Breakthroughs:

Zero-Input Derivation: The theory requires no free physical parameters. All results emerge from the statistics of the 2-qubit symmetric Bell state primitive and number-theoretic topology.

The 16/3 Dark Matter Ratio: We analytically derive Dark Matter as the SU(2) vacuum polarization response, predicting a mass ratio of Ω_DM / Ω_b = 16/3 ≈ 5.333. This matches the PDG 2025 observation (5.38 ± 0.15) to within 0.3σ.

Precise Higgs Mass: We derive m_H = 125.1 ± 0.3 GeV via a dissipative gauge stabilization mechanism, resolving the Hierarchy Problem without Supersymmetry.

Unified Scale: The Grand Unified Scale is derived as Λ ≈ 3.03 × 10^16 GeV.

Falsifiability: The theory provides specific, testable predictions for the HL-LHC (Top quark coupling plateau) and LISA (Gravitational wave double peaks).
